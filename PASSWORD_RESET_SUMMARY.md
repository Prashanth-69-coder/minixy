# Password Reset Functionality Summary

## Overview
The Minixy platform includes a complete password reset functionality that allows users to securely reset their passwords if they forget them. This feature was already partially implemented and has been completed with all necessary components.

## Implementation Status
✅ **Fully Implemented and Working**

## Components

### 1. User Interface
- **Forgot Password Page** (`/forgot-password`): Allows users to request a password reset by entering their email
- **Reset Password Page** (`/reset-password`): Allows users to enter a new password after clicking a reset link

### 2. Backend Implementation
- **Controller Routes** in `src/controllers/auth_controller.py`:
  - `GET /forgot-password` - Displays forgot password form
  - `POST /api/forgot-password` - Processes password reset request
  - `GET /reset-password` - Displays reset password form with token
  - `POST /api/reset-password` - Processes new password

- **Service Layer** in `src/services/auth_services.py`:
  - `reset_password(email)` - Handles password reset requests
  - `update_password(token, password)` - Updates user password

- **Repository Layer** in `src/repositories/auth_repository.py`:
  - `reset_password(email)` - Sends reset email via Supabase
  - `update_password(token, password)` - Updates password in Supabase

### 3. Templates
- `templates/forgot_password.html` - Forgot password form
- `templates/reset_password.html` - Reset password form

## How It Works

### Step 1: Request Password Reset
1. User clicks "Forgot your password?" link on login page
2. User enters their email address on forgot password page
3. System validates email format
4. System sends reset email via Supabase

### Step 2: Reset Password
1. User clicks reset link in email (contains token)
2. User enters and confirms new password on reset page
3. System validates password strength
4. System updates password in Supabase
5. User is redirected to login with success message

## Security Features
- ✅ Password strength requirements (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
- ✅ Token-based reset for secure authentication
- ✅ Input sanitization and validation
- ✅ Rate limiting (handled by Supabase)
- ✅ Secure password storage (handled by Supabase)

## Recent Improvements
- Added missing GET route for reset password page (`/reset-password`)
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Improved documentation

## Testing
The functionality has been verified to work correctly with:
- Valid email address submission
- Password strength validation
- Token-based password update
- Proper error handling for invalid inputs

## Integration
This feature integrates seamlessly with:
- Existing authentication system
- Supabase authentication services
- Current session management
- Existing UI design patterns

The password reset functionality is now complete and ready for production use.
