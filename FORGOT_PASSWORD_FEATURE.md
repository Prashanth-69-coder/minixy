# Forgot Password Feature Implementation

## Overview
The Minixy platform now includes a complete forgot password functionality that allows users to reset their passwords securely. This feature is already implemented and working.

## Components

### 1. Frontend Templates
- **[forgot_password.html](file:///e:/minixy/templates/forgot_password.html)**: Page where users enter their email to request a password reset
- **[reset_password.html](file:///e:/minixy/templates/reset_password.html)**: Page where users enter their new password after clicking the reset link

### 2. Backend Routes
Located in [auth_controller.py](file:///e:/minixy/src/controllers/auth_controller.py):
- `GET /forgot-password` - Displays the forgot password form
- `POST /api/forgot-password` - Processes the password reset request
- `GET /reset-password` - Displays the reset password form (with token)
- `POST /api/reset-password` - Processes the new password

### 3. Service Layer
Located in [auth_services.py](file:///e:/minixy/src/services/auth_services.py):
- `reset_password(email)` - Sends reset email via Supabase
- `update_password(token, password)` - Updates password using reset token

### 4. Repository Layer
Located in [auth_repository.py](file:///e:/minixy/src/repositories/auth_repository.py):
- `reset_password(email)` - Calls Supabase reset password email function
- `update_password(token, password)` - Uses Supabase auth to update password with token

## How It Works

### Password Reset Request Flow
1. User clicks "Forgot your password?" link on login page
2. User enters their email address on the forgot password page
3. System validates the email format
4. System sends a password reset email via Supabase
5. User receives email with a reset link

### Password Reset Flow
1. User clicks the reset link in their email
2. The link contains a token that opens the reset password page
3. User enters and confirms their new password
4. System validates password strength requirements
5. System updates the password in Supabase
6. User is redirected to login page with success message

## Security Features
- Password strength validation (8+ characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, special character)
- Token-based password reset for secure authentication
- Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting protection (handled by Supabase)
- Secure password storage (handled by Supabase)

## Testing the Feature

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Navigate to `/login` page
2. Click on "Forgot your password?" link
3. Enter a registered email address
4. Check email for reset link (in development, this might be in Supabase dashboard)
5. Click the reset link
6. Enter a new password that meets requirements
7. Confirm the new password
8. Verify you're redirected to login with success message
9. Try logging in with the new password

## Password Requirements
The system enforces strong passwords with the following requirements:
- At least 8 characters long
- One uppercase letter
- One lowercase letter
- One number
- One special character

## Error Handling
The feature includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid email formats
- Unregistered email addresses
- Expired or invalid reset tokens
- Password mismatch between fields
- Passwords not meeting requirements
- System errors during processing

## Integration Points
- Uses Supabase authentication system for secure password management
- Integrates with existing email validation utilities
- Works with current session management system
- Maintains consistent styling with rest of the application

This implementation provides a secure, user-friendly way for users to reset their passwords when they've forgotten them.
