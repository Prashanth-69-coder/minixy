- Real-time UI updates for user interactions
- Form validation and submission handling

### API Integration
- RESTful API calls using fetch API
- Async/await for handling asynchronous operations
- Error handling and user feedback

### UI Components
- Modal dialogs for forms and information display
- Dynamic search and filtering
- Real-time messaging interface
- Interactive elements with visual feedback

### User Experience Enhancements
- Loading indicators during API calls
- Success/error notifications
- Keyboard navigation support
- Responsive design adjustments

## Security Features

### Authentication
- JWT-based session management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Protected routes and API endpoints

### Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure API communication
- Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

## Development Practices

### Code Organization
- Separation of concerns (MVC pattern)
- Reusable components and functions
- Consistent naming conventions
- Modular JavaScript components

### Best Practices Implemented
- Asynchronous programming with proper error handling
- Event delegation for efficient event management
